# What is the difference between constant and read only in c#?

## Constant (const)
**Constant** can be used with the `const` keyword in C# which is also known immutable values which are known at compile time and do not change their values at run time. 

Const's are implicitly `static`. You use a `ClassName.ConstantName` notation to access them. Constant fields and locals aren't variables and may not be modified. Constants can be numbers, Boolean values, strings, or a null reference.

### Donâ€™t create a constant to represent information that you expect to change at any time

The `static` modifier is not allowed in a constant declaration.

    public class ConstTest 
    {
        class SampleClass
        {
            public int x;
            public int y;
            public const int c1 = 5;
            public const int c2 = c1 + 5;

            public SampleClass(int p1, int p2) 
            {
                x = p1; 
                y = p2;
            }
        }

        static void Main()
        {
            SampleClass mC = new SampleClass(11, 22);
            Console.WriteLine("x = {0}, y = {1}", mC.x, mC.y);
            Console.WriteLine("c1 = {0}, c2 = {1}", 
                            SampleClass.c1, SampleClass.c2);
        }
    }
    /* Output
        x = 11, y = 22
        c1 = 5, c2 = 10
    */

## Readonly (readonly)
**Readonly** can be used by the `readonly` keyword in C# which is also known immutable values and are known at compile and run time. 

`readonly` indicates that assignment to the field can only occur as part of the declaration or in a constructor in the same class. 

You can assign a value to a readonly field only in the following contexts:

When the variable is initialized in the declaration, for example:
 -  When the variable is initialized in the declaration, for example:

        public readonly int y = 5;
 - In an instance constructor of the class that contains the instance field declaration.
 - In the static constructor of the class that contains the static field declaration.


 
        class SampleClass
        {
            public int x;
            // Initialize a readonly field
            public readonly int y = 25;
            public readonly int z;

            public SampleClass()
            {
                // Initialize a readonly instance field
                z = 24;
            }

            public SampleClass(int p1, int p2, int p3)
            {
                x = p1;
                y = p2;
                z = p3;
            }

            static void Main()
            {
                SampleClass p1 = new SampleClass(11, 21, 32);   // OK
                Console.WriteLine($"p1: x={p1.x}, y={p1.y}, z={p1.z}");
                SampleClass p2 = new SampleClass();
                p2.x = 55;   // OK
                Console.WriteLine($"p2: x={p2.x}, y={p2.y}, z={p2.z}");
            }
            /*
            Output:
                p1: x=11, y=21, z=32
                p2: x=55, y=25, z=24
            */
        }

In the preceding example, if you use a statement like the following example:

    p2.y = 66; // Error

you will get the compiler error message:

    A readonly field cannot be assigned to (except in a constructor or a variable initializer)
