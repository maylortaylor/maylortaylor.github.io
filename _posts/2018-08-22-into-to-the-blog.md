# Intro to the blog

This blog will be the place I will document my journey of experiencing new development environments, best coding practices, learning various languages more in depth, and random knowledge dumps.

I would like to take this time to warn readers of this blog that not all of the code found within will be solely mine; nor will all of the words be soley mine. I am using this a collection area for items, practices, examples, and knowledge I find useful and helpful.

Some of the contents of this blog might be taken from other sites with slight wording tweaks. I will try and link to all of the places I reference at the end of each post.

Thank you for finding this page on the internet ^__^
