					In December of 2018, I decided to better myself and my development practices by getting ScrumMaster
					Certified <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/get-certified/practitioners/csm-certification">(CSM)</a>
					by <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/" target="_blank">ScrumAlliance</a>.

				<p>
					Serendipitously met <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-parks-bovsi">Matthew Parks</a>, owner of <a href="https://bovsistudios.com/">Bovsi
						Studios</a>, at <a href="http://grassrootskavahouse.com/">Grassroots Kava House</a>. He invited me to be a
					Senior
					Software Engineer at his growing company. I help artchitect applications, plan projects, and manage a team of

				<p>
					My first year and half at <a href="http://presence.io">Presence.io</a> (formerly Check I’m Here) involved me
					and
					a
					Senior Developer re-architecting an
					MVP application. The application we designed was a .NETCORE C# MVC Framework web app with a SQL database,
					AngularJS 1.6 front-end framework using the component-router and Typescript, and a C# RESTful API with the
					repository pattern design.

					<br>
					<br>

					During my time with the company, I was the lead developer for the company’s mobile API and the go-to developer
					for
					general C# or SQL questions. I worked closely with the customer service team to help test the system’s UI and
					APIs. I also worked with the CEO / product owner (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reubenpressman/">Reuben
						Pressman</a>) on a daily basis to gather requirements for new features and
					define business logic for existing features.
					I also helped upgrade and maintain the Node.js application that our customer service team used internally.

					I was the IT administrator at <a href="https://www.appliedtechres.com/">Applied Technology Resources</a>
					handling
					tasks such as creating new employee accounts, preparing computers for new
					users, doing general Windows repairs on employees’ computers, and troubleshooting the network.

					<br>
					<br>

					Due to my skill set I was able to transition this into a more senior role creating queries for the SQL and
					MySQL
					databases, updating/repairing custom written .NET C# and VB programs, updating/maintaining the Microsoft
					Access
					program that employees used, and creating various applications that helped the company’s processes.
