		<p>
			I am a highly skilled Full Stack Developer with 6+ years of
			experience in a real world work environment. I currently live
			in the St Petersburg, FL area and have been doing so since 2011.

			I got my start as an **IT Admin / Backend Developer** at a technology company
			in Seminole, FL where I was in charge of doing general IT work such as 
			fixing employee computers and managing users. I eventually was able to gain
			enough knowledge at this company to help them with their SQL databases, Access databases,
			and any C# applications they needed to be developed.
			
			I made my way to a educational SaaS company in the fall of 2014. I was one of two developers
			for the first 2 years at this company. In those two years, we redesigned the company's applications
			to be forward-thinking. We designed a SQL / C# backend (using Dapper .NET for the ORM) with an
			AngularJS 1.6 frontend using .NETCORE's MVC framework.

			More recently (summer 2018) I have been learning technologies outside of my wheelhouse such as
			PHP (Laravel), Docker, and React.
